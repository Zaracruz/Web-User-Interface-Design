        <h1>Introduction To Web Architecture</h1>
        <article>Web architecture is the design and layout of a website.</article>
        <article>A web server is an application installed on a physical or virtual server
           that uses HTTP to serve the files that make up web pages to users browsers
           in response to their requests.</article>
          <article>A server can be physical or virtual, physical servers are placed in racks.</article>

          <h1>Web Protocols</h1>
          <section><h2>HTTP:</h2>(Hyper Text Protocol) Defines rules for requesting and transferring web resources.</section>
          <section><h2>HTTPS:</h2>This is the secure version of HTTP it uses encrytption(ssl/tls) to protect data.</section>
          <section><h2>TCP/IP:</h2>When data is sent over the interent protocol called Tranmission Control Protocol
           is used. TCP takes care of communication between your application software and your network software. 
           it is responsible for breaking down data into IP packets before they are sent and assembling them when they arrive</section>
           <section><h2>FTP:</h2>File Transfer Protocol enables transfer of files such as your web files from your local machine up on to a web browser.</section>


           <h1>Web Concepts</h1>
           <div class="concept-group">
            <h2>URLs and DNs</h2>
            <section>URL stands for uniform resource locators</section>
            <figure><img src="assets/img/example-url-structure.png"> Figure 1: </figure>
            <section>DNS stands for domain name system. it translates human readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing browsers
                to locate web servers by name rather than numerical IP addresses.
            </section>
            <h2>TLD:</h2>
            <section><h3>This is the last segment of your domain name, e.g. :</h3>
                <dl>.ie</dl>
                <dl>.com</dl>
                <dl>.net</dl>
                <dl>.info</dl>
            </section>

            <h1>Cookies and browsers</h1>
            <section>Cookies ar small pieces of data sent by web servers to a clients broswer, used for users authentication, session management and tracking
             user behavior.</section>

             <h3>Rendering Engines</h3>
             <dl>Chromium</dl>
             <dl>Webkit</dl>
             <dl>Gecho</dl>

             <h3>Caching</h3>
            <section>Involves stroing copies of frequently accessed web resources on the intermidiary side(e.g proxy). It reduces
                the load on web servers and improves page load times by serving cached content
            </section>
