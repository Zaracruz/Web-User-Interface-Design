    <article><h2>My name is Zara Cruise, I am currently a student studying Interactive Digital Art and design
        at Setu Carlow. I have a passion for Art and learning new skills. During my first year of the IDAD
        course I learned a lot about coding and developed skills in games development, but progressing into second
        year I began to learn more about web development, and absolutely love it. My choice of course allows me to
        be creative and have fun. I've taken my love for art and made it digital!<h2></article>
